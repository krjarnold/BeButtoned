The game that Be-Buttoned is modeled after is Bejeweled which was one of the predecessors to the now popular Candy Crush Saga.

The basic gameplay is a Match-3 mechanic where players try to match three or more similar buttons in a horizontal or vertical line on the board. The player is only allowed to switch two buttons that are next to each other (not diagonal).  Once a cluster of three is formed, the buttons in the cluster are removed, and the player get points based on how many buttons are removed.  If they run out of moves and can't switch any more buttons to make a match- they lose.
