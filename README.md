# BeButtoned
Bejewelled clone. 

Bejeweled is one of the predecessors to the now popular Candy Crush Saga. The basic gameplay is a Match-3 mechanic where players try to match three or more similar objects in a horizontal or vertical line on a grid. The player is only allowed to switch two objects that are next to each other (not diagonal).  Once a cluster is formed, the tiles in the cluster are removed, and the player get points based on how many tiles are removed.  There is a clock running, and the player wins by getting the most points they can.  If they run out of moves and can't switch any more tiles to make a match- they lose.
